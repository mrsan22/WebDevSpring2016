<!--When you assign ng-controller, the div or any HTML becomes view of MVC and is controlled by that controller-->
<!--The controller will be responsible for processing that data and providing it and notifying the view, then view will
render the data. This controller has this div as its scope and it cannot access anything outside this scope.-->
